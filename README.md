## Description


Thrift Store is a groundbreaking website designed to revolutionize online commerce in Palestine, offering unique services such as buying and selling products with unprecedented features. Users have the freedom to upload, modify, and delete products across various categories, as well as conveniently add items to their wishlist for easy access. Registration is free, without subscription fees, ensuring everyone can benefit from the platform's offerings.

Additionally, we introduce a premium service where users can elevate their listings by paying a nominal fee to feature them prominently in search results and on the homepage for a specified duration. Continuous technical support is provided to address any inquiries or issues, ensuring a seamless user experience.

This project was meticulously developed under the guidance and mentorship of the dedicated technical team within Microsoft R&D team / ASAL Tech., working closely with our instructor Amjad Abu Hassan who led the Advanced Software Engineering course. The system incorporates three user roles—customer, guest, and admin—to effectively address any concerns or inquiries while ensuring smooth operation throughout the buying, selling, and customer update processes.

## Adittional Information

Our project underwent development within a closed environment on Azure DevOps, generously provided by ASAL's team, ensuring efficient collaboration and streamlined workflow. To facilitate documentation and transparency, we subsequently published the project on GitHub. This meticulous process allowed us to maintain version control and ensure accessibility for future reference and enhancement endeavors.
